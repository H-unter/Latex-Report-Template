# LaTeX Template - See it [Here](main.pdf)
Template for making IEEEish style engineering reports for uni. [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxcWWkx2DMnQmj5os2X5ZR73) informed a fair bit of this. Chat GPT is also really good at debugging formatting things when stuff breaks.

I use Visual Studio Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension for local editing. This setup is beneficial because it provides access to your computer's local files.  This ensures that if you have any code as an appendix, or you have figures which are produced using other software in your document, that any changes to these files will automatically reflect in the document. I find this handy enough to give up the ease of use provided by Overleaf.
