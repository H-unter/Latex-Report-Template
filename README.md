# LaTeX Template
Template for making IEEEish style engineering reports
- `main` branch: IEEE LaTeX template files.
- `Example-PH2019` branch: an example use case

## Features
- Automatic document outline for easy navigation
- Contents page hyperlinking
- Ability to render 2d/3d graphics in latex as opposed to screenshotting a premade one (though it is a pain, and screenshotting ends up being easier)

## TODO
- Generalise and improve csv file implementation
    - Round numbers
    - Figure out header names
- Configure referencing
- Tikz colour boxes
